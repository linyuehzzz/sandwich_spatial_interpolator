`sandwichr` is an R package for spatial interpolation based on the spatial stratified heterogeneity (SSH) theory, which enables users to:

  - Interpolate the sampling attribute over the reporting units that
    does not rely on spatial autocorrelation;
  - Assess the interpolation uncertainties through standard errors and
    confidence intervals;
  - Evaluate the overall accuracy using a diagnostic statistic called
    the k-fold cross validation estimate.
    
You may also find this package on CRAN: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sandwichr/.

## Getting setup with R

Using the `sandwichr` package requires a recent version of R to be
installed on your computer. The easiest way is to install it through
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) , which stands for the Comprehensive
R Archive Network.

  - For Windows, visit <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/>.
  - For macOS, visit <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/>.
  - For Linux, visit
    <https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html>.

Once R is installed, you can proceed to install the RStudio Integrated
Development Environment (IDE) to have a much improved environment to
work with R. [Here](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) is
detailed description of RStudio. It is free to download on
<https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/#download/>.

## Installing the package

Now you have the base R and a nice IDE installed on your computer, you
can navigate to the console window (in RStudio, the bottom left panel)
and install the `sandwichr` package by executing the following lines of code:

``` r
install.packages("sandwichr")
```

## Tutorial

Once you install the package, we strongly recommend you going through a
tutorial of this package to explore it in different scenarios of use.
You can find it using the argument:

``` r
browseVignettes("sandwichr")
```
