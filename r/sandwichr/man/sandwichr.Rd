\title{\code{sandwichr}: Spatial Interpolation Based on Spatial Stratified Heterogeneity}
\description{
The package \code{sandwichr} provides tools to interpolate a spatially stratified heterogeneous population with high accuracy, even when its spatial autocorrelation is weak. These tools allow the calculation of critical summarized statistics such as geodetector \emph{q}. They also enable the visualization of the interpolated surface as well as the standard error and confidence interval maps.
