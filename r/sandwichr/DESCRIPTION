Description: Spatial interpolation is a common practice in social and environmental science. This package enables the implementation of SSH-based spatial interpolation proposed by Wang et al. (2013) <doi:10.1068/a44710>. It provides functions to (1) evaluate stratification schemes, (2) interpolate sampling data over user-defined reporting units, (3) assess interpolation uncertainties, and (4) evaluate overall accuracy using the k-fold cross-validation estimate.
