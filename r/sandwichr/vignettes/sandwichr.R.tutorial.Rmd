The `sandwichr` package performs spatial interpolation^[Wang, J. F., Haining, R., Liu, T. J., Li, L. F., & Jiang, C. S. (2013). Sandwich estimation for multi-unit reporting on a stratified heterogeneous surface. *Environment and Planning A*, 45(10), 2515-2534.] based on the spatial stratified heterogeneity (SSH) theory^[Wang, J. F., Haining, R., Liu, T. J., Li, L. F., & Jiang, C. S. (2013). Sandwich estimation for multi-unit reporting on a stratified heterogeneous surface. *Environment and Planning A*, 45(10), 2515-2534.]. This model requires three inputs: sampling, SSH, and reporting layers. The goal of this model is to estimate the mean value of the sampling attribute and its standard error for each reporting unit leveraging the known distribution of the population in the SSH layer. Since this model does not rely on the spatial dependence of the population, when the spatial dependence is weak, Sandwich is still applicable as long as one properly stratifies the geospatial surface. Figure 1 is an overview of the model structure.

To use the `sandwichr` package, first install it from source code (only do this once).
```{r}
# Install the sandwichr package
# install.packages("sandwichr")
```

Then load the installed package into your environment using `library()`. Remember to load the package every time you use it.
```{r}
# Import the sandwichr package and other packages
library("sandwichr")
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)
library(dplyr)
```

Here,we present two case studies to demonstrate the functionality of this package.

## Human population in Heshun County, China
The first case study interpolates the human population density in Heshun County, China based on a sample of 167 units. A zonation consists of 5 spatially contiguous strata is used as a candidate SSH layer. The administrative division of 10 townships in Heshun County is used as the reporting layer. The sampling, SSH, and reporting layers are all in the shapefile format.

### Loading data
To successfully run the model, the `load.data.shp` function is used to prepare the shapefiles of sampling, SSH, and reporting layers into a list of `sf` (simple feature; see [Simple Features for R](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/index.html) for references) objects for model input. You can specify the directory and names of your input files. Note that these input files should locate in the same di
```{r}
# Input data from shapefiles
hs.sampling.name <- system.file("extdata", "hs.sampling.shapefile.shp", 
                                package="sandwichr")
hs.ssh.name <- system.file("extdata", "hs.ssh.shapefile.shp", 
                           package="sandwichr")
hs.reporting.name <- system.file("extdata", "hs.reporting.shapefile.shp", 
                                 package="sandwichr")

hs.data <- load.data.shp(sampling.file=hs.sampling.name, 
                      ssh.file=hs.ssh.name,
                      reporting.file=hs.reporting.name)

# Sampling
head(hs.data[[1]])
class(hs.data[[1]])
attributes(hs.data[[1]])

# SSH
head(hs.data[[2]])
class(hs.data[[2]])
attributes(hs.data[[2]])

# Reporting
head(hs.data[[3]])
class(hs.data[[3]])
attributes(hs.data[[3]])
```


### Selection of the SSH layer(s)
The accuracy of SSH-based spatial interpolation is determined by the SSH layer. For an ideal SSH layer, values of the target attribute are expected to be homogeneous within each stratum and differ between the strata. To determine a proper SSH layer for the Sandwich model, the geographical detector model^[Wang, J. F., Li, X. H., Christakos, G., Liao, Y. L., Zhang, T., Gu, X., & Zheng, X. Y. (2010). Geographical detectors-based health risk assessment and its application in the neural tube defects study of the Heshun Region, China. *International Journal of Geographical Information Science*, 24(1), 107-127.] is applied to quantify the SSH of the target attribute with regard to the candidate stratification(s). 

For the purpose of demonstration, we input `hs.ssh2.shapefile` as another candidate SSH layer.
```{r}
library(sf)
library(tools)
# Input another candidate SSH layer for demonstration
hs.ssh2.name <- system.file("extdata", "hs.ssh2.shapefile.shp", 
                            package="sandwichr")
hs.ssh2 <- read_sf(dsn=dirname(hs.ssh2.name),
                    layer=file_path_sans_ext(basename(hs.ssh2.name)))
```

First, we combine the sampling and the candidate SSH layers to a single data frame.
```{r}
# Prepare the SSH layer(s) for evaluation
hs.join <- ssh.data.shp(object=hs.data[[1]], ssh.lyr=hs.data[[2]], ssh.id="STR_1")
hs.join <- ssh.data.shp(object=hs.join, ssh.lyr=hs.ssh2, ssh.id="STR_2")
head(hs.join)
```

The factor detector *q*-statistic in the geographical detector model is applied through the `ssh.test` function to measure the SSH of the sampling data in terms of different stratifications. This function takes a data frame generated from the `ssh.data.shp` (or `ssh.data.txt`, which will be introduced later) function (argument `object`), where the field names of the sampling attribute (argument `y`) and the strata ID(s) (argument `x`) need to be specified. In this example, the output of `ssh.test` implies that the original candidate SSH layer (*q* = .91) has a higher determinant power over the attribute (population density) compared to hs.ssh2 (*q* = .39). Therefore, compared to `hs.ssh2`, it will be more reasonable to select the original one as the SSH layer for subsequent interpolation.
```{r}
# Calculate the geographical detector q-statistic
ssh.test(object=hs.join, y="Population", x=c("STR_1", "STR_2"), test="factor")
```

The `ssh.test` function implements the interaction detector in the geographical detector model by specifying `test="interaction"`. The result of our example shows that the combined *q*-statistic of the original candidate SSH layer and `hs.ssh2` (*q* = .92) is approximately the same as that of using the original one alone (*q* = .91). Therefore, we can either optimize the SSH layer by combining two SSH layers or simply use the original one. For the purpose of simplicity, we will use the original one alone as the SSH layer in the subsequent modeling.
```{r}
# Calculate the interaction detector
ssh.test(object=hs.join, y="Population", x=c("STR_1", "STR_2"), test="interaction")
```


### Running the Sandwich model
The SSH-based spatial interpolation is performed using the `sandwich.model` function, which outputs the mean value of the sampling attribute and its standard error for each reporting unit.
```{r}
# Perform the SSH based spatial interpolation
hs.sw <- sandwich.model(object=hs.data, sampling.attr="Population", type="shp")
head(hs.sw$object)
summary(hs.sw)
```

The interpolated values and the standard errors can be visualized using `plot.mean` and `plot.se()`.
```{r fig.align="center", fig.width=8, fig.height=3}
# Plot the estimated mean values and standard errors
ggplot2::autoplot(object=hs.sw)
```

The confidence interval for the population mean in each reporting unit is computed using the `sandwich.ci` function. Here, we show an example of constructing a 95% confidence interval.
```{r}
# Calculate the confidence intervals of the interpolation estimates
hs.sw.ci <- sandwich.ci(object=hs.sw, level=.95)
head(hs.sw.ci$object$object)
summary(hs.sw.ci)
```

The lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval can be visualized using the `plot.ci` function.
```{r fig.align="center", fig.width=8, fig.height=3}
# Plot the confidence intervals of the interpolation estimates
ggplot2::autoplot(object=hs.sw.ci)
```

### Model validation
To evaluate the overall accuracy of the SSH-based spatial interpolation, a *k*-fold cross validation can be performed using the `sandwich.cv` function. A diagnostic statistic called root mean square error (RMSE) will be calculated. Here, we present the result of a 5-fold cross validation.
```{r}
# Perform k-fold cross validation
set.seed(0)
hs.cv <- sandwich.cv(object=hs.data, sampling.attr="Population", k=5, type="shp")
hs.cv
```


## Breast cancer incidence in mainland China
The second case study interpolates the breast cancer incidence across mainland China based on 242 samples retrieved from the Chinese Cancer Registry Annual Report. The urban-rural classification (either urban or rural areas are typically not connected in space) is used as the SSH layer. County-level divisions are used as the reporting units. In this example, all the input data are in csv format.

### Loading data
The `load.data.txt` function is used to prepare text files into a list of data frames for model input. Two files are needed for this function: one linking sampling and SSH layers, and the other linking reporting and SSH layers. 

```{r}
# Input data from text files
bc.sampling_ssh.name <- system.file("extdata", "bc_sampling_ssh.csv", 
                                package="sandwichr")
bc.reporting_ssh.name <- system.file("extdata", "bc_reporting_ssh.csv", 
                                 package="sandwichr")

bc.data <- load.data.txt(sampling_ssh.file=bc.sampling_ssh.name, 
                         reporting_ssh.file=bc.reporting_ssh.name)

# Sampling-SSH
head(bc.data[[1]])    
class(bc.data[[1]])

# Reporting-SSH
head(bc.data[[2]])    
class(bc.data[[2]])
```


### Selection of the SSH layer(s)
First, we use the `ssh.data.txt` function to convert the input data for evaluation.
```{r}
# Prepare the SSH layer for evaluation
bc.join <- ssh.data.txt(object=bc.data)
head(bc.join)
```

The factor detector *q*-statistic in the geographical detector model is applied through the `ssh.test` function to measure the SSH of the sample regarding the urban-rural classification. In this example, the output of `ssh.test` implies a relatively high level of SSH in the distribution of breast cancer incidence concerning the given stratification (*q* = .52). Therefore, it is reasonable to select the urban-rural classification as the SSH layer for subsequent interpolation.
```{r}
# Calculate the geographical detector q-statistic
ssh.test(object=bc.join, y="Incidence", x="SSHID", test="factor", type="txt")
```

We can visualize the mean and standard deviation of the sampled breast cancer incidence in each stratum.
```{r}
p = ggerrorplot(bc.data[[1]], x = "SSHID", y = "Incidence", 
            desc_stat = "mean_sd", color = "black",
            add = "violin", add.params = list(color = "darkgray")
            )

p + scale_x_discrete(labels=c("1" = "Urban", "2" = "Rural")) + 
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank()) + labs(y="Breast Cancer Incidence (Rate per 100,000)")

bc.data[[1]] %>%                                        
  group_by(SSHID) %>%                         
  summarise_at(vars(Incidence),              
               list(name = mean))               
```


### Running the Sandwich model
The SSH-based spatial interpolation is performed using the `sandwich.model` function, which outputs the mean value of the sampling attribute and its standard error for each reporting unit.
```{r}
# Perform the SSH based spatial interpolation
bc.sw <- sandwich.model(object=bc.data, sampling.attr="Incidence", type="txt", 
                        ssh.id.col="SSHID", ssh.weights=list(c(1,2), c("W1","W2")))
head(bc.sw$object)
summary(bc.sw)
```

The confidence interval for the population mean in each reporting unit is computed using the `sandwich.ci` function. Here, we show an example of constructing a 95% confidence interval.
```{r}
# Calculate the confidence intervals of the interpolation estimates
bc.sw.ci <- sandwich.ci(object=bc.sw, level=.95)
head(bc.sw.ci$object$object)
summary(bc.sw.ci)
```


### Model validation
To evaluate the overall accuracy of SSH-based spatial interpolation, a *k*-fold cross validation can be performed using the `sandwich.cv` function. A diagnostic statistic called root mean square error (RMSE) will be calculated. Here, we present the result of a 5-fold cross validation.
```{r}
# Perform k-fold cross validation
set.seed(0)
bc.cv <- sandwich.cv(object=bc.data, sampling.attr="Incidence", k=5, type="txt", 
                     ssh.id.col="SSHID", reporting.id.col="GBCODE", 
                     ssh.weights=list(c(1,2), c("W1","W2")))
bc.cv
```
