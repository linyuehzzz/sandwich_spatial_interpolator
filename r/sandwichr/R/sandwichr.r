#' \code{sandwichr}: Spatial Prediction Based on Spatial Stratified Heterogeneity
#'
#' The package \code{sandwichr} provides tools to predict a spatially stratified heterogeneous population with high accuracy, even when its spatial autocorrelation is weak. These tools allow the calculation of critical summarized statistics such as geodetector \emph{q}. They also enable the visualization of the interpolated surface as well as the standard error and confidence interval maps.
