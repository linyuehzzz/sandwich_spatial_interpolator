#' \code{rsandwich}: Spatial Interpolation based on Spatial Stratified Heterogeneity
#'
#' The package \code{rsandwich} provides tools to interpolate a spatially stratified heterogeneous population with high accuracy, even when its spatial autocorrelation is weak. These tools allow the calculation of critical summarized statistics such as Geodetector \emph{q}. They also enable the visualization of the interpolated surface as well as the standard error and confidence interval maps.
