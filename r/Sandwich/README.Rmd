`Sandwich` is an R package for spatial interpolation based on the [spatial stratified heterogeneity (SSH)](http://www.geodetector.cn/) theory. You can find more details about the method [here](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1068/a44710). 

## Getting setup with R
Using the `Sandwich` package requires a recent version of R to be installed on your computer. The easiest way is to install it through [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) , which stands for the Comprehensive R Archive Network.

- For Windows, visit <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/>.
- For macOS, visit <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/>.
- For Linux, visit <https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html>.


Once R is installed, you can proceed to install the RStudio Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to have a much improved environment to work with R. [Here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) is detailed description of RStudio. It is free to download on <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download>.


## Installing the package
Now you have the base R and a nice IDE installed on your computer, you can navigate to the console window (in RStudio, the bottom left panel) and install the `Sandwich` package from source code by executing the following lines of code:
``` r
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("linyuehzzz/sandwich_spatial_interpolator", subdir="r/Sandwich")
```
