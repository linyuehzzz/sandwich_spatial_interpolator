# Sandwich: a novel software for spatial interpolation of spatially stratified heterogeneous populations

**Sandwich** is a cross-platform open-source spatial interpolation tool that supports [the Sandwich interpolation model](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1068/a44710?journalCode=epna).


Here's something you need to know/do before you run the source codes of **Sandwich**.

Configuration settings
--------
Configuration settings in the development of **Sandwich**:

| Option| Setting |
| ------ | ------ |
| Development language | C++ |
| Software development kit (SDK) | Qt 5.6.3 |
| Integrated development environment (IDE)|Qt Creator 4.0.3 (Community) |
| Compiler | MSVC 2015 (32-bit) |
| UI | Qt Designer |
| Support library | GDAL-2.2.1, OpenGL |

Configuration steps
--------
To run the source code of **Sandwich** (in Windows, for example), please follow the steps below.
  - **Step 1**: Download [Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable Update 3](https://my.visualstudio.com/Downloads?PId=6542) and [Visual C++ Build Tools 2015 Update 3](https://my.visualstudio.com/Downloads?PId=6542). Install the first package by default. For the second one, use ‚Äúcustom install‚Äù to install the version that corresponds to that of your Windows.
  - **Step 2**: Download [Windows 10 SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk), and install the feature ‚ÄúDebugging Tools for Windows‚Äù.
  - **Step 3**: Download [qt-opensource-windows-x86-msvc2015-5.6.3.exe](https://download.qt.io/archive/qt/5.6/5.6.3/), and install it by default.
  - **Step 4**: Make sure that the folder **gdal_2.1.1** is put in the same parent folder with **Sandwich-v1.5**. Click Sandwich.pro and run the code in Qt Creator.
